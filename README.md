# Machine Learning with R

# Introduction

This repository provides complete examples of machine learning algorithms using the statistical software R. Topics covered include the concepts and complete examples of machine learning, regression methods, classification, clustering, and neural networks.

The [machine learning cheat sheet](./MachineLearningCheatSheet_R.pdf) outlines machine learning concepts, R libraries, and mathematics. It is organized by machine learning tasks (supervised learning, unspervised learning, etc.).

All data used to train and test the machine learning algorithms in this package are stored in the 'data' folder, or are pulled from APIs, R packages, and web scraping techniques.

## Topics

### Supervised:

#### Regression Algorithms

- [Simple Linear Regression](./algorithms/SimpleLinearRegression.R)
- [Multiple Linear Regression](./algorithms/MultipleLinearRegression.R)
- [Logistic Regression](./algorithms/LogisticRegression.R)
- [Regression Trees](./algorithms/RegressionTree.R)

#### Classification Algorithms

- [Decision Tree Classifiers](./algorithms/DecisionTreeClassifier.R)
- [Naïve Bayes Classifiers](./algorithms/NaiveBayes.R)

### Unsupervised:

#### Neural Networks

- [Artifical Neural Networks](./algorithms/NeuralNetwork.R)

## Getting Started with R

You will need an integrated development environment (IDE) such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to execute R code.

It is recommended that you have a foundational understanding of both statistics and R to effectively use machine learning. The [Statistics with R course on GitHub](https://github.com/matthewfishermv/Statistics-with-R/) is a good place to start.
