# Machine Learning with R

# Introduction

This repository provides complete examples of machine learning algorithms using the R statistical software.

The [machine learning cheat sheet](./MachineLearningCheatSheet_R.pdf) outlines machine learning concepts, R libraries, and mathematics. It is organized by machine learning tasks (supervised learning, unspervised learning, etc.).

All data used to train and test the machine learning algorithms in this package are stored in the 'data' folder, or are pulled from APIs, R packages, and web scraping techniques.

## Topics

### Supervised Learning Algorithms

- [Simple Linear Regression](./algorithms/SimpleLinearRegression.R)
- [Decision Tree Classifier](./algorithms/DecisionTreeClassifier.R)
- [Naive Bayes Classifier](./algorithms/NaiveBayes.R)

## Getting Started with R

You will need an integrated development environment (IDE) such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to execute R code.

It is recommended that you have a foundational understanding of both statistics and R to effectively use machine learning. The [Statistics with R course on GitHub]([Statistics with R course on GitHub](https://github.com/matthewfishermv/Statistics-with-R/)) is a good place to start.
